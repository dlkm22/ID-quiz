# Valorant Quizzes

**VALORANT** is a tactical, first person shooter game that is available on Windows. 

The goal of our website is to provide entertainment to user's by testing their knowledge on VALORANT, and hopefully convince user's who have never played VALORANT before to give it a try.

# Design Process

The website is primarily for user's who have played VALORANT before and enjoy the game. VALORANT is mostly competitive in nature, so having a quiz page with points and a leaderboard supports the idea of competitiveness even outside of VALORANT. This website is good for user's who want to pastime without playing VALORANT as it can be quite time consuming, but our quizzes are short and works the user's brain.

- As a user who has played VALORANT, I want to be able to access the quizzes and leaderboard easily.

- As a user who has not played VALORANT before, I want to find out more about the game and why I should try it out.
